# The family standard

These sixteen repositories are one family and are held to one standard. Where
they differ, the difference must be something the hardware forces, not something
nobody got round to.

## The authority ladder

Every factual question is answered by the highest rung that has an answer, and a
lower rung never overrules a higher one.

1. **Manufacturer documentation.** Anything printed decides. Read it in full
   rather than searching it, because the passages that matter are the ones
   nobody quotes.
2. **The part's own program or the artefact itself.** A cartridge, a firmware
   image, a header. What the silicon was actually asked to do.
3. **A recording from an independent implementation**, for behaviour nobody
   documented.
4. **Nothing else.** An emulator, an FPGA core, a wiki and a forum post are rung
   3 at best and rung 4 for anything printed.

A document that contradicts itself is common. When it does, the cycle table and
the pin descriptions have both times been right and the prose wrong.

**Never calibrate against an emulator where a document exists.** A recording is
evidence about behaviour nobody wrote down. It is not evidence about a register
width, a bit name, or anything else a manufacturer printed, however many
implementations agree with it. Where a recording contradicts a document, the
document wins, the disagreement is written down, and the model follows the
document.

**A recording whose answer depends on the machine it was built on is not evidence
at all.** It is a property of the recorder, and it is excluded and named rather
than allowed to decide.

## What every repository carries

| Gate | Standard |
|:--|:--|
| Format | `ruff format --check .`, clean |
| Lint | `ruff check .`, zero findings |
| Types | `mypy` at strict plus every optional error class, zero findings |
| Tests | `<module>.test.py` beside the module, run individually |
| Coverage | 100% statement and branch, enforced, on a machine holding no artefacts |
| JSON | `pnpm run format:check`, with every submodule tree exempted |
| CI | lint, types, tests on 3.12/3.13/3.14, plus the project's own conformance job |
| Schedule | a weekly run against unpinned tools and the newest runtime, starting on ground the pipeline never reaches |
| Analysis | CodeQL and Scorecard |
| Release | semantic-release from `main`, never tagged by hand |
| Docs | README, AGENTS.md plus the one-line pointer each tool reads, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, CODE_OF_CONDUCT |
| Review | CODEOWNERS on every path, and templates that ask a report for the run that settles it |
| Specs | `specs/current/`, requirements with checkable scenarios |
| Hardware facts | `conformance/hardware.json`, every fact with the sentence it came from |
| Disagreements | `conformance/divergences.json`, both readings and what would settle it |

## Conventions that are not negotiable

| Thing | Rule |
|:--|:--|
| Language | Python only |
| Comments | None in source, ever. Docstrings carry the reasoning |
| Test structure | Arrange, blank line, one act, blank line, assert. No section labels |
| Nothing starts clean | Memory and registers hold what they held, from a seed |
| Artefacts | Never committed: no ROM, no firmware, no fragment of one |
| Only retail dumps | A ROM hack is somebody's edit, not what hardware ran |
| Package manager | pnpm, never npm |

## What a conformance runner must report

A runner asked about ground it has never been held to has three options and two
of them are lies. Reporting agreement lies about the part. Skipping in silence
lies about the run, because the summary then counts a comparison that never
happened. The third is to refuse: name what was compared, name what was not and
why, and count the two apart.

Report per part, never one number over parts with different evidence. One part
held to its manufacturer's manual and another held to nothing are not one figure.

## The state of this repository
## The state of this repository

Everything in the table above is in place. Six suites, six parts, held to
manufacturer documentation for what the manufacturers printed and to the pinned
recordings for everything they did not.

**The watcher was reporting on one suite and ignoring five.** The six suites do
not come from one place: the 65816 cases live in ProcessorTests and the other
five live in 65x02. The scheduled job probed the first definition and stopped, so
for five of six suites nothing was ever asked, and the green badge of a watcher
that ran every week read as coverage of all of them.

It now groups the definitions by repository and probes each group, and the survey
lives in [`conformance/watch.py`](conformance/watch.py) under the same coverage
gate as everything else rather than inline in YAML where nothing checks it. A
test asserts that the repository holding most of the suites is not the first one,
which is precisely the condition that made the old watcher wrong.

**Two suites pinned to one repository must agree about the commit**, and the
survey refuses rather than picking one. They are checked out together, so a
disagreement would mean one of them is fetched at a commit the other was never
tested against.

**An upstream that cannot be reached counts as not moved.** A scheduled job that
opens a pull request every time a network call fails is a job somebody turns off.
